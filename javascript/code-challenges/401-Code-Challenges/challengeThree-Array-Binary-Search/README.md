# Array Binary Search

* Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

* To start we utilized inVision to document our Problem Domain and started to Visualize that problem. An algorithm was created to detail a step by step method to achieve the desired outcome. From there we we're able to write our code in JavaScript.
